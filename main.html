        <h2> The facts about the universe </h2>
    
   
        <img src="heic0910s.jpg" width="\linewidth" height="200">
        <p> The universe is overwhelmingly made up of things that cannot be seen. In fact, the stars, planets and galaxies that can be detected make up only 4 percent of the universe, according to astronomers. The other 96 percent is made up of substances that cannot be seen or easily comprehended.

These elusive substances, called dark energy and dark matter, have not been detected, but astronomers base their existence on the gravitational influence that both exert on normal matter, the parts of the universe that can be seen.</p>

        <h3>Ten top facts about our solar system… and beyond!</h3>
        <ul> 
            <li> There are more stars in the universe than grains of sand on all the beaches on Earth. That’s at least a billion trillion! </li>
        
            <li> A black hole is created when big stars explode. Its gravitational force is so strong that nothing can escape from it – luckily the closest black hole is about 10,000 light-years from Earth. </li>
            
            <li>When venturing into space, astronauts wear spacesuits which have to be warmed, cooled, pressurised and supplied with fresh air. This takes six hours for them to put on!</li>

        <h3>There May Be More Universes</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>The cosmic microwave background is made up of light echoes left over from the Big Bang that created the universe 13.7 billion years ago. This relic of the Big Bang explosion hangs around the universe as a pocked veil of radiation.</li>
            
            <li>The European Space Agency's Planck mission mapped the entire sky in microwave light to reveal new clues about how the universe began. Planck's observations are the most precise views of the cosmic microwave background ever obtained. Scientists are hoping to use data from the mission to settle some of the most debated questions in cosmology, such as what happened immediately after the universe was formed. <a href="https://www.space.com/10627-planck-science-universe-cosmic-microwave-background.html" Full Story></a></li>
